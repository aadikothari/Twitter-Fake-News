# Twitter-Fake-News

We have provided a requirements.txt file using the pipreqs function. The ego machine was running Windows 10 and the commands were run by Powershell.
The same was tested in a macOS and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) based environment

Our version of code was ran on Python 3.10.0 and pip 22.0.4

STEPS to RUN:

1) CLONE the repo/DOWNLOAD the files (Make sure to be in the Twitter-Fake-News folder)
2) RUN the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3) OBSERVE that all libraries install
4) RUN the command 'python final.py'

While running the file, NOTICE 1) Comments. We kept helper methods for some functions from towardsdatascience.com and geeksforgeeks so as to aid us if needed.
However, those helper functions (if commented) are not used.

Comments explaining the code flowthrough are included.

Our script runs Neural Network and Decision Tree classifers.
