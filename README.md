# Twitter-Fake-News

We have provided a requirements.txt file using the pipreqs function. The ego machine was running Windows 10 and the commands were run by Powershell.
The same was tested in a macOS and WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) based environment

Our version of code was ran on Python 3.10.0 and pip 22.0.4

STEPS to RUN:

1) CLONE the repo/DOWNLOAD the files (Make sure to be in the Twitter-Fake-News folder)
2) RUN the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3) OBSERVE that all libraries install
4) RUN the command 'python final.py'
